# Custom Keys

## A project to improve workflows
This application operates by deploying multiple items (applications
and webpages) from a single click of a button. The multiple items are grouped
together by creating a Python list of links. For every list, a button is created.
When the button is pressed, all of the links associated with the button will open.
(I created this with the intention of opening both
URL scheme links to open desktop applications as well as web links
and I presume there are many other use cases for this program)
### The concept:
Group items together in a logical manner, so when they are
all opened at once would create a workstation
to save precious time. For example, one could open
all of their communication channels (multiple email accounts, slack,
messaging platforms, etc) or financial platforms (banks, investment accounts,
payment apps, etc) in one click on the custom_keys application.

## Requirements:
